# Moshify - Cloud Hosting Website Clone

This is a fully functional and responsive clone of the original Moshify cloud hosting website. Built with attention to detail, the project replicates the website's design and animations while following clean coding principles. The site was developed using a bottom-to-top approach, where individual components were built in isolation before integrating them into the final project.

## Live Demo
The site is hosted live on Netlify. You can view it here: [Moshify Clone](https://moshify-by-saqib.netlify.app/)

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The website adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring an optimal experience across devices.
- **Smooth Animations**: Includes all the original animations to enhance user interaction and experience.
- **Component-Based Structure**: Built by developing isolated components first, then combining them to form the complete website.
- **Core Technologies**: No frameworks used—just clean, modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
